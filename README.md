# Micromagnetics---Theory-and-Sim
In the following repository can the codes be found used for this project: <br />
For part 1: <br />
    - "magnetiteParticle.mx3" is the mumax3 file which generates the images of system and data <br />
    - "miniproject_part1.py" is the python code that generates the data and plts <br />
For part 2: <br />
    - "assessedexcersicepart2.py" is the python code that generates the data and plts <br />
    - "PyFilmPulse.mx3" is the mumax3 file to generate the system and caluclations. <br />
    - "*.txt" files are the resulting resonance frequencies generated by the calculations <br />
         * "resonanceFreq.txt" -  from m = uniform(-1,-1,0)
         * "resonanceFreq110.txt"  - from m = uniform(1,1,0)
